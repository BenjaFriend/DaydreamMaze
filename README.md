# Daydream Maze UE4

### What is this? 

This is a small proof of concept project where I wanted to experiment with using the Google Daydream headset and Unreal Engine 4. My idea was to have a small maze attatched to the rotation of the players motion controller, and they have to get a ball into a given goal. Similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LHbvWCwPw) _Zelda Breath of the Wild_ shrine.

I think that the concept has some cool potential for the future, as the Google Daydream market is somewhat small and it seems that there is a lack of games on that marketplace. 

This is what I have accomplished with this prototype: 

* Maze attatched to the motion controller ad rotating properly
* Respawn the ball when the user presses a reset button
* Goal particle effect when the user gets the ball in the right spot

### Pros / Cons
Here are some good things I can think of about further development on this project: 

* Quick and easy maze walls in the Unreal Engine editor, there isn't really a need for any extra tools for this
* There is a lot of freedom with mechanics that can be added
* Building and testing to Android with Unreal Engine is really quick and easy to do

Here are some potential struggles I see with this project: 

* Getting the ball to feel right with how bouncy / weighty it is
* Scaling the mazes right so that it feels consistent
